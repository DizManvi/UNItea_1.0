UNItea is comprised of two words, UNI for University and tea for the Gen-Z word "tea" meaning news/gossip. We believe that any opportunity or news of your own university should never be missed. Ours is a platform that aims at connecting students on a smaller scale since all the existing community applications aim at targeting audience on a large scale where your base virtue associated with your university and your peers is lost.
